The tool held in this repository is a PowerBi dashboard developed to help 
facilitate salt cavern development in the East Coast region of the UK.
It's value can be fully realised in the early planning/exploration phase, 
to highlight areas suitable for salt cavern development base on a suite 
of predefined criteria, governed by the user's requirements.

The tool uses coarse-level datasets to compare suitability across large 
areas. Due to its broad scale, the tool lacks the detailed information 
necessary for full feasibility studies, and as such, it should not be
used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
